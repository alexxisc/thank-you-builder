# Thank you builder

At GitHub, we like to say thanks to all the folks on our teams that helped with a particular feature launch. This website uses one of GitHub's coolest tricks to help you build out a quick grid of photos with all the people you choose on it.

To use, clone the repository, then fill out the `users` array with the GitHub handles of all the people you're looking to thank. You can adjust the inline CSS to change the size of the photos, or background color to suit your needs. Then just screenshot the results and paste into your slides. :tada:
